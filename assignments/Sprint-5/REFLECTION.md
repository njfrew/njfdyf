# REFLECTION
When this assignment was first assigned. I was going to try to make a web application, but I found it very difficult and got nowhere with this in the last Sprint. I was completely lost on where to start and had no idea how to implement any of it. So, I decided to abandon HybridAuth and the web application and focus on an iOS application. I was planning on using Firebase Authentication, but then I looked at Auth0 and found it incredibly simple and intuitive to use. I visited their docs pages and was able to set up the domain, client ID, and callback URL very easily. I found all of this a lot easier than trying to set up anything through Google's OAuth certification on their console website. I just had to give Auth0 my application name, and it gave me everything else and presented the steps to take very clearly. Auth0 had a sample project on their github that was really easy to understand and implement into my own project. I then had to do some retooling of my app. Overall, it was a pretty easy experience after I learned about Auth0. None of the other SSOs were nearily as easy to get working. Their docs were incredibly easy to follow, and I really enjoyed using Auth0. 

## The Future of My App
For now, my app is more of a demo because different accounts do not have different notes. No matter what account is signed in the same notes are displayed to the user. I would like to get each user to have their own specific notes, so I will try to figure out how to do multiple users with Core Data in the next week.
