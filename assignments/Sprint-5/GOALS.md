# GOALS
## Purpose of My App
My app is called Notes with SSO. The Purpose of the app is to have a user login using Auth0 and then allow them to make, edit, and delete notes. The notes have a title and content. The table of all the notes has the notes' title and the date they were last edited. This allows for people to easily make a note of whatever is on their mind and know what day those notes are from.
## Core Audience of My App
Notes with SSO's core audience is anyone looking for a simple notes app. The userbase could span any age because the UI is simple and intuitive; they just need an account that works with the SSO.
## Data Collecting and Displaying
My app collects data from the notes that user's take, and displays those notes to that user. Right now, this version of the app does not allow for data to be user specific, but I would like to implement that in the future. This is just a demo of the sign in and note taking. The data that my app would collect would not leave the user's device because I am using Core Data for data persistence.
