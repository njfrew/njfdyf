## How to Run My App
Download Notes With SSO First Iteration folder to your machine. Open the file Note with SSO.xcworkspace in Xcode. Hit the play button in the top left corner to build and run app on an iPhone simulator. The simulator runs like an iPhone. On the app, press the log in button, log in, create a note with the plus sign in the top right, give your note a title and content, save it, press the note in the table to view it or edit it, and go to the table and swipe left to delete the note.

## Technologies Used
I used iOS and Swift to build this app in Xcode. I used iOS's Core Data for data persistence. I used Auth0 for the SSO, and I used CocoaPods to download and use it on my app. 

## Second Iteration
For this iteration, I worked on getting my app ready to be published on the App Store. I made an icon for my app and went through this guide: https://themanifest.com/mobile-apps/how-publish-your-app-apples-app-store-2018 to find out everything I needed to do to get it published. Below you will find the documentation and description needed for being published on the App Store. Unfortunately, an Apple Developer account costs money, so I was unable to go any further in this process. But with the ground work set when I do have the money to afford an account this should be an easy process.

Notes with SSO is an iOS application that allows you to quickly create, edit, and delete important notes that you may take throughout the day.


## Getting Started

Use your preferred way to Log In to your device. Note: None of your data will leave your device

## Viewing your Notes

Now that you're signed in, you can see all of your notes listed in front of you, and when they were last edited. Tap any of the notes to see the content of that note and be able to edit them. Or tap the plus button to add a new note.

## Making a Note

Give your note a title and type in the content box below whatever you'd like. When you are done making your note, tap save or go back if you do not want to save it. If you wanted to add more to your note, do not worry you can always come back and edit your note later.

## Deleting a Note
