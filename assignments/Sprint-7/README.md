## How to Run My App
Download Notes With SSO First Iteration folder to your machine. Open the file Note with SSO.xcworkspace in Xcode. Hit the play button in the top left corner to build and run app on an iPhone simulator. The simulator runs like an iPhone. On the app, press the log in button, log in, create a note with the plus sign in the top right, give your note a title and content, save it, press the note in the table to view it or edit it, and go to the table and swipe left to delete the note.

## Technologies Used
I used iOS and Swift to build this app in Xcode. I used iOS's Core Data for data persistence. I used Auth0 for the SSO, and I used CocoaPods to download and use it on my app. 

## First Iteration
I changed the UI colors and the layout of the app for a more unique and sleeker look. I tried to add multi-user functionality, but my app uses Core Data for data persistence which means a multi-user experience does not make sense. I would also have to completely rebuild the app and use a web server or CloudKit. I am unsure of what I'll add for my second iteration, but I don't plan on adding multi-user functionality to this app.
