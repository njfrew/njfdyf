## How to Run My App
Download Notes With SSO First Iteration folder to your machine. Open the file Note with SSO.xcworkspace in Xcode. Hit the play button in the top left corner to build and run app on an iPhone simulator. The simulator runs like an iPhone. On the app, press the log in button, log in, create a note with the plus sign in the top right, give your note a title and content, save it, press the note in the table to view it or edit it, and go to the table and swipe left to delete the note.

## Technologies Used
I used iOS and Swift to build this app in Xcode. I used iOS's Core Data for data persistence. I used Auth0 for the SSO, and I used CocoaPods to download and use it on my app. 

## Second Iteration
For this iteration, I worked on getting my app ready to be published on the App Store. I made an icon for my app and went through this guide: https://themanifest.com/mobile-apps/how-publish-your-app-apples-app-store-2018 to find out everything I needed to do to get it published. Below you will find the documentation and description needed for being published on the App Store. Unfortunately, an Apple Developer account costs money, so I was unable to go any further in this process. But with the ground work set when I do have the money to afford an account this should be an easy process.
