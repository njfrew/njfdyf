Assignment 11

I plan to participate in the Evolution Working Group. I also listened to the podcast and found it interesting how open source projects can foster a sense of community. I also thought it was interesting that when they decided to discuss community health a lot people ended up coming to be a part of the discussion, which they werenâ€™t expecting. The CHAOSS project seems to be incredibly valuable, but it seems the ongoing conversation within the CHAOSS project is what metrics are valuable and important for measuring community health. Although, it does not seem like there are certain metrics that work for every person or company, and each person or company may their own thoughts on what metrics are important.
