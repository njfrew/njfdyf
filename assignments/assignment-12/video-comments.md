## Video Comments

In the video, Carter and Dr. Goggins discuss metrics and layouts of metrics. I think it is important that they clarified the layout of the metrics. I will be taking this into consideration. I also find it particularly interesting that we need to be so specific with our language, but I think it is important for consistency and specificity. Some specific things that I need to do are follow the subtitle formatting like with aggregators and parameters, only ask one question, and like I said earlier be specific with your wording.

## Working Group

I said in assignment 11 that I will be participating in the Evolution Working Group, and I will be joining the call on April 15th. Well, I meant to join the Evolution Working Group call, but the link was incorrect on assignment 11. So, I accidently joined the D&I call.

## Pull Request

I will be submitting a pull request for the Evolution Working Group with my metric.
