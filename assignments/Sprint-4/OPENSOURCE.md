# Why Participate in Open Source:
## Article 1
This topic is incredibly interesting. The answer is not simple. After reading both of the articles provided, it seems the answer comes down to whoever is being asked and the task at hand. 

Some participate in open-source for money or career development. Maybe it is part of their job, or they want to learn new skills to further them in their career. These are extrinsic motivations.

Others will participate in open-source for altruism. They want to add code to the community. Or for fun, they enjoy adding and being a part of an open-source project.

I think most people who participate in open source are somewhere in between in that they enjoy programming, but as the first article said that only goes so far. People need some kind of extrinsic motivation to get them going or their motivations will fall off. And they will everntually move on.

## Article 2

This article is based on a study of FOSS and more specifically business models of FOSS. The article goes in depth on how open-source is becoming bigger and bigger, but the community around open source does not agree on what models work.

In the study, they got industry experts and real developers to decide the most effective business models. They narrowed it down to ten with two being the most important. The business models they concluded to are Advertising, Auxiliary services, Corporate development and distribution, crowdfunding, proprietary relicensing, memberships and donations, SaaS with distribution of server software, and Update subscriptions. With the top two being Selling user data and Software Certification.

Although, in the end it is realized that not one of the business models is sustainable on its own. For developers, project managers, entrepeneurs, venture capitalist, and whoever else relevant to keep coming back to an open-source project a hybrid model seems to be the most effective.

This study and article are important because they go into how to make open-source better, and the article answers at part of the question at hand, why participate in open-source. Well, the part of the answer this study reveals is the best thing the commmunity of a project can do is to decide an effective business model like the ones above to incentivize whoever relevant to participate and continue to participate in a project.
