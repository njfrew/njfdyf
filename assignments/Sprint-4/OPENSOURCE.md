# Why Participate in Open Source:
## Article 1
This topic is incredibly interesting. The answer is not simple. After reading both of the articles provided, it seems the answer comes down to whoever is being asked and the task at hand. 

Some participate in open-source for money or career development. Maybe it is part of their job, or they want to learn new skills to further them in their career. These are extrinsic motivations.

Others will participate in open-source for altruism. They want to add code to the community. Or for fun, they enjoy adding and being a part of an open-source project.

I think most people who participate in open source are somewhere in between in that they enjoy programming, but as the first article said that only goes so far. People need some kind of extrinsic motivation to get them going or their motivations will fall off. And they will everntually move on.

## Article 2

The Linux Foundationa article talks, at first, about business incentives of being involved with open-source projects. One reason is to attact talent. Another is to lower maintenance cost of a project by allowing your maintenance to be in every version of a project. The third one is it allows a business to influence the direction of a project, which is insurmountably valuable.

The article then goes into the hierarchy of open-source project communities. This hierarchy is important for creating a sense of structure within a community. And how to contribute to a project which is different in each project and also presents a form of structure.

When organizations contribute, they must follow the project guidelines and objectives just like anyone else who contributes. This is so they do not affect the true goals of a project.  

For the normal contributor, they recommend to lurk first, read rules, and start small. They also recommend to get involved with community. And they recommend to have a plan for your contributions.

This article explains some of the reasons to contribute to open-source from an individual's perspective and a businesses. They explain that businesses can gain a lot from contributing to open-source and that well-structured projects should incentivize the individual to contribute because they know exactly what and how they are contributing to the project, which overall makes the contribution more meaningful. This incentivizes the contributors to keep coming back to the project.
