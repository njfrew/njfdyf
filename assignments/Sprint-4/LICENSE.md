# Licenses

I would prefer to use a license like the Apache License. The reason for this is the license allows for the user of the software to have free reign over the software. But it still gives the control over the software to the licensor and legal entity.

I also appreciate the lack of legal jargon. The license is easy to read, and for people without legal backgrounds like the average developer that is important for the sake of clarity.
