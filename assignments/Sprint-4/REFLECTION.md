# Reflection
## What Projects I looked at
I looked at Sails, OpenID, and OAuth. OAuth is the one I chose to look into more. It is an open-source SSO protocol that gives an application a secure way to authorize logins. It is standardized and simple, according to them, and can be used for a lot of different platforms.

## Why I chose OAuth
I chose OAuth because the documentation was the easiest to follow, but I still found it incredibly confusing. I think I would have to learn a lot more javascript skills to be able to get this SSO to work, and I was unable to do this in this timeframe.

## How far did I get
I did not get far at all. I went through all the instructions that OAuth had for a web application implementation. I think I am missing a foundational knowledge to apply this protocol to a web application. But I followed the instructions, and they made sense to an extent. The protocol is supposed to send you to an authorization page, and after you login, it sends you back to the page. I was very confused and ran out of time to figure it out. But I spent quite a few hours trying to figure this out.

## My problems that I ran into
I ran into the problem of how exactly do I apply the instructions. Where do I put the protocol? How do I program the JS around this protocol? I think I followed OAuth's instructions to an extent, but not knowing where to apply these instructions made it almost impossible to get anywhere with this application. I tried.
